Goal
The goal of this exercise is to develop a fuzzy record matching program that takes records from “query” set and finds matching record in the “reference” set.
 
Data
In the attached excel file, there are two sheets:
-          “reference” sheet  contains a list of restaurants, its address and cuisine (“reference” set)
-          “query” sheet contains again a list of restaurants, its address and cuisine, plus two additional columns (“query” set)
o   “reference_id” column needs to be populated using the fuzzy record matching program
o   “score(optional)” field can show to what degree the record matches or the confidence of the match.
